# Pong Game

A basic pong game using SVGs.

## Setup

**Install:**

`> npm i`

**Run:**

`> npm start`

## Keys

**Player 1:**
* a: up
* z: down
* spaceBar: pause
* shiftKey: Bomb Mode

**Player 2:**
* ▲ : up
* ▼: down
* spaceBar: pause
* shiftKey: Bomb Mode

## Other implementations

-On shiftKey it adds a new ball, and when this ball scores even once, the game ends. 
It makes pong quite a bit more intense.

-At 5 points scored, the game is over, and the winner is declared on the screen.

-I redeisgned the pong game to look like a tennis court.

-Added difficulty settings, by giving the ability to increase and decrease ballspeed 


## What I learned

This project, although tough, was great for learning. It really forced you to 
understand how instances work, which was the most valuable take away for me.

I got to experience webpack for the first time, and it really made my life easier,
it'll be great to take the boiler plate code to my next project.

The fact that this project was basically all vanilla JavaScript really required
me to learn programming in a way that could only be achieved by doing..
